# Dengue_mdelling
Dengue Modelling based on Netlogo
This Netlogo model attempts to capture Dengue epidemic using Host & Vector layer.
The goal is to find how Dengue spreads , account for seasonal variation in Model , Visualization of different control measures and overall provide a robust modelling to account for actual epidempic impact.

Proposed simulation framework will simulate Dengue epidemic using Agent based modelling ( ABM )
ABM will help us interaction between different agents in play and the environmental considerations

Agents will be mainly segregated as:
  Host layer ( Humans )
  Vector layer ( Mosquitoes )

Simulation engine for below is developed ( current status )
	Human stage transition:  Susceptible -> Infected - > Recovered / Dead 
	Vector stage changes : Eggs -> Larva - Pupa - > Adult
	Bite based on hunger for female vector
	Spread of infection based on bite
	Vector reproduction via Laying eË€gs in breeding zones
	Time step for day and night
	Host and Vector mobility
	Human killing vector probabilistically
	Eventual vector death
	Immunity for immunity duration
